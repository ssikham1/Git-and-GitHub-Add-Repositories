Currently, course #254 within Udemy "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" training.  This course introduces students to the version control using Git within the command line.

- Within the command prompt/hyper, change directories (cd) into the folder containing the chapter1.txt file (cd "C:\Users\ssikh\OneDrive\Documents\Udemy\The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp\Web Development\Story")
- If you want to create the file using the command line, use 'touch chapter1.txt'
- Create a git local repository to track the changes. Need to initialize git by using 'git init'
- In order to track changes, the file needs to be added to a staging area.  Use 'git status' to check on the file status and then use 'git add chapter1.txt' to add the file.
